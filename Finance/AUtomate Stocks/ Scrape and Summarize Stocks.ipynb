       "  'Dubai, United Arab Emirates--(Newsfile Corp. - February 22, 2022) - Recently, LBank Exchange held an AMA session with the Radio Caca (RACA) team, discussed topics about RACA\\'s Play-to-Earn Metamon game, economic system, Metaverse and NFT features, cooperation with universities, tokenomics, and many more. Figure 1: RACA Talks About Play-to-Earn Game “Metamon” in an AMA with LBank Exchange Radio Caca is the exclusive manager of Maye Musk Mystery Box (MPB) NFT and governance token for The United States of Mars (USM) Metaverse - an MMO 3D Mapping Metaverse with the same style of Decentraland, while USM has the first-ever shown feature on the game market globally - a real 3D Planet that can be proportionally zoomed in and zoomed out. Metamon, the game where RACA plays the role of \"AXS\" in AXIE Infinity, was launched by the Radio Caca team on the BSC in October 2021 and has been planned to be expanded into the USM later. Maye Musk - The Valuable Mystery Box The first series released by Radio Caca is Maye Musk\\'s NFT. The reason for this name is that the team positions Maye Musk\\'s NFT work as the highest-ranking works in the Radio Caca market and the entire NFT market in the future. Like the slogan circulating in the community, Maye Musk, NFT Mother. It is a treasure box to get unlimited NFT works. Holding the Mother Box will get the airdrop of subsequent NFT works and the highest courtesy in the Radio Caca market. The collection value of Mother Box is enormous. Maye Musk issues her own NFT on BSC, which represents a significant and representative event for the entire blockchain industry.

       "  'The adherents of the YOLO movement are a young bunch of diehard optimists believing in a single stock and its future performance, pitching in all the chips they have, while hoping for the best. The meme phenomenon has spread far and wide beyond the obscure dark and not-so-dark humor online boards into the financial market, with crypto meme coin tickers taking up the precious characters of Tweets posted by some prominent investors like Elon Musk. But it has recently overspilled into the conventional financial industry of Wall Street, taking on the form of the YOLO movement. This bizarre phenomenon has seen stocks being pumped beyond even the most optimistic prices by online message boards in an almost coordinated tidal wave that swept across the booming market through 2020 and 2021. With over 80% of investors in YOLO stocks being born in the late 1990s, their overconfidence in continued market growth is staggering, allowing them to take on leverage in the form of credits and debts to start investing in selected stocks. And though there is no actual asset class that could be termed YOLO, it pertains to companies that have posted immense gains and generated headlines during the pandemic lockdown period. Among the most notable examples over 2020 to 2021 are AMC Entertainment (AMC), which skyrocketed by over 2,000% in just under a year, and GameStop (GME)– up 5,232% in the past year. Others in the league are Bed, Bath & Beyond (BBY) with 328% gains, Blackberry (BB) – 113% year-to-date, and others. It all started in early 2021 with GameStop Corp. (GME), which saw its stocks boosted by a group of Reddit users who started investing in it and attracted others to do so. The price soared tenfold from $4 in 2020 to $350 in early 2021. And though stocks eventually took a nosedive to $40 by February of 2021, the GME saga allowed some investors to make millions in short positions on its traction in under a few weeks. Needless to say, a legend was born that took on a life of its own and spread like wildfire,',\n",
       "  'The video game studio buying frenzy that’s erupted in recent weeks may just be an industry-wide case of fear of missing out (FOMO), according to analysts. January’s string of big and small deals for game developers has seen Take-Two (TTWO) – the publisher behind heavy-hitting franchises like Red Dead Redemption and Bioshock, make a near $13 billion bid for mobile game giant Zynga. Not to be outdone, Microsoft (MSFT) announced it would buy Activision Blizzard (ATVI) for a whopping $68.7 billion in an all-cash deal that would unite franchises like Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush together with the makers of the Xbox. Michael Pachter, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities, told Yahoo Finance Live last week that the software giant’s move for Activision is part of a bolder “vision and a strategy.” The deal essentially gives Microsoft more games and properties – not just for its traditional consoles, but to help grow its efforts in mobile gaming and cloud computing. More recently, the gaming boom culminated with Sony (SONY) announcing a $3.6 billion deal for Bungie, the studio behind “Halo” and “Destiny,” while The New York Times (NYT) is buying the viral crossword game Wordle for an undisclosed price “in the low seven figures.” Pachter told Yahoo Finance that Sony’s purchase of Bungie was driven more by FOMO, citing the higher price the Japanese giant paid per developer when compared to Microsoft’s Activision bid. “Sony, I think, just did a ‘me too’ statement and said we’re not gonna be left behind, so we’ll buy Bungie,” he added. And other companies – like Google (GOOG), which has its own cloud gaming service – might yet join the video gaming land grab, analysts say. Yet some think major players are in a wait-and-see mode, especially with the more recent deals undergoing regulatory review. “Anything that Google or any of the other platforms might do from an acquisition standpoint will rightfully get a lot of scrutiny,” Daniel Flax, senior research analyst at Neuberger Berman, told Yahoo Finance. He added that Google will likely focus on maturing the',\n",
       "  'Charlie Munger is worth billions but the legendary investor likes to note that he doesn’t have absolute power. If he did, he says he\\'d be a \"benign dictator\" but make some big changes in the way stock market works. At the recent annual meeting of the Daily Journal (DJCO), his publishing and technology company, he described the 2021 meme-stock frenzy as a “speculative orgy.” “What we\\'re getting is wretched excess and danger for the country,” he said, comparing trading activity to an out-of-control party. “A lot of people like a drunken brawl, and so far those are the people that are winning, and a lot of people are making money out of our brawl.” It has been about a year since stocks like Gamestop (GME) and AMC (AMC) began to see wild price fluctuations driven by retail investors as the \\'meme stock\\' phenomenon took off. The activity came after an influx of liquidity in the markets as a result of government stimulus as well as the rise of online destinations like r/wallstreetbets on Reddit. Munger has tangled with day traders often over the last year. Trading app Robinhood (HOOD), the epicenter of much of this trading, responded to previous comments by Warren Buffett and Munger by saying that the two billionaires \"insulted a new generation\" of investors for \"doing things in a new way.\" Munger, 98, is vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A / BRK-B). The company, headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska, has long been led by Warren Buffett, who serves as chairman and chief executive. Munger says he knows exactly what he would do about the perceived problem. He would make short-term trading much less profitable. He wants to add higher taxes on short-term capital gains and make the stock market much less liquid as a consequence. In Munger’s vision, stocks would operate closer to the way the real estate market works, in which there are significant barriers to constantly trading your assets. He says that the current situation on Wall Street means that “not the most admirable people” are able to prey on individual investors who enjoy the excitement',\n",
       "  'HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam, Feb. 22, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Introducing CryptoZeroFi, one of such games aiming to make a name for itself in this maturing space. CryptoZeroFi is an upcoming Realistic Combat Role-Playing NFT game built on the Binance Smart Chain. Similar to other games in this industry, it incorporates NFTs as well as a P2E model. Keeping up with the trend, they also have plans for metaverse-integration set in their pipeline. The NFT Play-To-Earn (P2E) gaming industry has been gaining a lot of traction lately, especially with the increasing sentiment towards the metaverse. There have been countless new projects determined to be a pioneer in this booming industry. What sets these new lines of games apart from conventional games is the ability to rack up rewards while playing the game, allowing gamers to make money while doing what they enjoy most. The integration of non-fungible assets (NFTs) also allows for the transferability of in-game assets, thereby enabling players to trade and gift their assets with one another. CryptoZeroFi features two in-game tokens, ZERI and ZEUS, which can be earned by players in-game. They can then choose to sell these tokens in exchange for other cryptocurrencies or stake them in one of the various staking options to earn some additional rewards. Alternatively, players can also earn respectable rewards by winning the \"Arena of Fame\" tournament which will be held yearly. Additionally, CryptoZeroFi also has an integrated NFT marketplace and NFT Transfer functionality, allowing players to trade or gift their in-game characters and weapons with one another. Furthermore, CryptoZeroFi will feature a clan system. Players will be able to create a clan and invite their friends and family to play alongside them. They can also earn some extra rewards for inviting others using their unique invitation code. Last but not least, as mentioned, CryptoZeroFi is planning to integrate metaverse-capabilities into their project. This means that it might not be long before players will be able to put on a set of VR goggles and dive right into the world of CryptoZeroFi.

       "  \"Lowe's shares rise after Q4 results top expectations Ten game development studios in Africa have come together under one umbrella, the Pan Africa Gaming Group (PAGG), in an effort to unify the continent’s gaming sector, which is currently fragmented. The association is further envisioned to drive the uptake of gaming in the continent, and grow developer talent. The announcement was made today against the backdrop of the Africa Games Week 2022, which is taking place in Cape Town, South Africa. The PAGG said they aim to grow the industry by two times annually, and to put Africa “on the map of the global game industry.” The gaming studios in the new lobby are South Africa’s Sea Monster, Senegal’s Kayfo Games, Cameroon’s Kiro'o Games, Ghana’s Leti Arts, Tunisia’s Digital Mania, Ethiopia’s Qene Games, Kenya’s Usiku Games, Tanzania’s Khanga Rue, DopeApps from Rwanda and Messeka Games, with more are expected to join soon. Collectively, the current members have developed more than 50 games. The PAGG will bring together games developed by its members for publishing under Gara, an African game store, and AfroComix, a content hub for Afrocentric creative work. These channels will enable content distribution and monetization by allowing locally relevant payment options including mobile money and airtime billing. They also plan to increase the number of Africa’s next generation game developers through training and incubation, a function that has already taken off in Kenya, at the Nairobi Game Development Center. “One of our core values is not just to build a collection of games, but to incubate Africa's gaming industry of tomorrow. There is a wealth of incredible talent already on the continent, with more graduating every year from top-tier game development schools like Rubika. Most graduates though are relegated to doing remote work for overseas clients due to the lack of local gaming job opportunities. We’re going to fix that,” said Leti Arts CEO Eyram Tawia. PAGG founders are hoping to grow the gaming industry in Africa by two times yearly. Image Credits: PAGG The lobby will be governed by a founders’ council to be made up of top\"],\n",
       " 'TSLA': [\"Tesla’s (TSLA) accusations this week that the Securities and Exchange Commission reneged on a 2018 settlement agreement requiring it to distribute $40 million to shareholders could be backed up by the agency's own rules requiring it to submit a fund distribution plan within 60 days of receiving payment. In a letter filed in federal court in Manhattan on Thursday, attorneys for Tesla claimed the agency held up $40 million in penalty funds that CEO Elon Musk and Tesla paid in 2018 to settle a dispute over his tweet claiming he secured funding that could take the electric vehicle giant private. Tesla’s lawyers have asked the court to examine why shareholders haven't received the money in the more than 1,200 days since Tesla and Musk each handed over $20 million to the agency. “Simply stated, the SEC has failed to comply with its promise to pay Tesla’s shareholders the $40 million it collected,” the letter states. The letter goes on to say that instead of distributing the funds to Tesla shareholders, the SEC has been “devoting its formidable resources to endless, unfounded investigations into Mr. Musk and Tesla.” Should the court agree to address Tesla’s concerns, the SEC will contend with its own rules that set a deadline for plan submissions, as well as its records showing that the vast majority of “available funds” it collects and redirects under the Fair Funds for Investors provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act go to impacted shareholders within two years of a distribution plan's approval. Settlements allocated under the Fair Funds provision can come from either administrative proceedings initiated by the SEC, or from litigation between the SEC and defendants such as Tesla and Musk in federal courts. Tesla’s lawyers say that although nearly three and a half years have passed since Musk and Tesla paid their penalties, the agency has “yet to announce anything like a distribution plan.” The time frame, they argue, flies in the face of the agency’s Rules of Practice, specifying that its enforcement division must submit a proposed distribution plan within 60 days of receiving a defendant’s settlement payment. “As\",\n",
       "  'Tesla CEO Elon Musk\\'s lawyer has accused the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or leaking information about a federal probe to retaliate against him, CNBC has reported. \"It has become clearer and clearer that the Commission is out to retaliate against my clients for exercising their First Amendment rights—most recently by criticizing the Commission on the public docket and by petitioning this Court for relief,\" said Musk attorney Alex Spiro. It\\'s the latest shot fired by Musk in his ongoing dispute with the SEC that started in 2018 when he said that he had secured funding for a private buyout of Tesla at $420 a share — something many (including the SEC) interpreted as an attempt at a weed joke. The SEC fined Tesla and Musk $20 million each over that and forced Musk to step down as chairman for at least three years. Tesla also had to implement a system for monitoring Musk\\'s statements about the company on Twitter and other media. Musk has been chafing against those rules lately, however. Earlier this month he accused the SEC of conducting a \"harassment campaign,\" and \"stifling\" has First Amendment free speech rights. The SEC responded earlier this week, saying its frequent check-ins with Tesla were effectively required by the court overseeing the 2018 settlement. It also rebutted Musk\\'s other complaint, saying that it was making progress disbursing the $40 million fine to shareholders as it had promised. Musk\\'s lawyers alleged that at least one SEC member had leaked \"certain information regarding its investigation,\" but it didn\\'t say who or which information. Tesla revealed in its 2021 Q4 earnings report that the SEC subpoenaed the company and Musk, seeking information on how they\\'re complying with the 2018 settlement. Musk previously ran afoul of the 2018 settlement a year later after tweeting information about Tesla vehicle production that wasn\\'t approved by the company\\'s \"disclosure counsel.\" His lawyers accused the SEC of violating his free speech rights then, too. Musk and Tesla eventually agreed to a revised settlement that required him to get approval in advance for any tweets or other communication from',\n",
       "  'The US Environmental Protection Agency has reached a settlement with Tesla after the agency found that the automaker violated the Clean Air Act at its factory in Fremont, California. In particular, the EPA determined that Tesla violated the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Surface Coating of Automobiles and Light-Duty Trucks from October 2016 to September 2019. Tesla, the EPA said, failed to develop and implement a work practice plan to minimize air pollutants emissions from the storage and mixing of materials used in vehicle coating. It also failed to correctly perform the monthly calculations needed to prove that its coating operations complied with the federal standards for hazardous air pollutants. Finally, Tesla apparently failed to keep required records of the calculations for its air pollutants emissions rate. \"People living in communities that are near sources of hazardous air pollutants may face significant risks to their health and environment,\" the agency wrote in its announcement. According to CNBC, the paint shop at Tesla\\'s factory in Fremont suffered several fires within that period. The news organizations talked to employees back in 2018 who claimed that the company pushed to hit production goals at the expense of fire and environmental considerations. (If you\\'ll recall, Tesla was struggling to hit Model 3 production goals at the time.) Those employees claimed that months before a fire in April that year, the shop\\'s sprinkler heads were clogged and were coated with at least an inch of thick paint. Exhaust systems that were supposed to carry clean air in and out of the building were allegedly coated with thick paint, as well. \"Today\\'s enforcement action against Tesla reflects EPA\\'s continued commitment to ensure compliance with federal clean air laws,\" EPA Pacific Southwest Regional Administrator Martha Guzman said in a statement. Tesla will only have to $275,000 to settle its violations, however, which is a drop in the ocean for a company that reported a $5.5 billion in net income last year. The union that wants to represent workers at Amazon’s BHM1 facility in Bessemer, Alabama is accusing the company of once again violating the',\n",

On Wednesday, Tesla CEO Elon Musk shot down the potential for a $25,000 car this year as it focuses resources on the rollout of full-self driving technologies and secures scarce semiconductors for higher priced models such as the Model 3 and Model Y. Explained Musk, \"We\\'re not currently working on that $25,000 car. We at some point will. We have enough on our plate right now, too much on our plates, frankly. So at some point there will be, but I think that\\'s sort of a question that it\\'s just sort of the wrong question. Really the thing that overwhelmingly matters is when is the car autonomous.\" Robots appear to be more of a focus inside Tesla than a $25,000 car. Traders let Musk know of their letdown coming off the earnings call. Shares plunged 7.6% to $864 on the session as Tesla said its business would be weighed down by supply chain challenges, mostly as it relates to semiconductor shortages. The company also said it would not unveil any new models this year, let alone a $25,000 EV. \"Overall, while we continue to have an above consensus volume and margin outlook in 2022/\\'23, and assign a premium tech-skewed valuation multiple (~35x EBITDA), that is still not enough for us to recommend the stock at this time,\" added Faghri. Here is how Tesla performed compared to Wall Street analyst estimates: Revenue: $17.719 billion vs. $16.64 billion expected Adjusted earnings per share: $2.54 vs. $2.37 expected Suffice it to say, the Wall Street bulls on Tesla generally remained unshaken in their enthusiasm for the stock despite any perceived earnings call disappointment. \"Our message to investors is that Tesla is still a ‘must own’ in the sense that owning the stock is',\n",
       "  \"Lowe's shares rise after Q4 results top expectations DETROIT (AP) — Elon Musk and his lawyers are escalating their fight with U.S. securities regulators, with a lawyer accusing them of leaking investigative information, and the Tesla CEO alleging on Twitter that government corruption is being exposed. Musk's tweet early Tuesday and a Monday letter from Musk lawyer Alex Spiro to a federal judge didn't offer any specifics about the leak, but the actions ramped up a war of words with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The agency isn't the only federal regulator that Musk is sparring with. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recently has stepped up enforcement against Tesla. Last week, Musk called the agency the “fun police” for making Tesla recall a “Boombox” function that can play sounds over an external speaker and obscure audible warnings for pedestrians. The safety agency has launched multiple investigations of Tesla and is overseeing 15 Tesla recalls since January of 2021. Recalls include “Full Self-Driving” software being programmed to run stop signs at slow speeds. Investigations include unexpected braking by Tesla vehicles. On Monday, Spiro filed another letter with the U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan accusing at least one SEC staff member of leaking information about an investigation of Musk and Tesla's compliance with a court order aimed at controlling his tweets. “It has become clearer and clearer that the commission is out to retaliate against my clients for exercising their First Amendment rights,” Spiro wrote. Tuesday morning, Musk tweeted that the allegations are “just peeling back the first layer of the corruption onion. Stay tuned.” No details were given. The SEC declined comment Tuesday, and messages were left seeking details about the leak allegations from Tesla and Spiro. The SEC spat goes back to 2018, when Musk and Tesla each agreed to pay $20 million in civil fines  over Musk’s tweets about having the money to take the company private at $420 per share. The funding was far from secured and the company remains public. The settlement specified governance changes, including Musk’s ouster as board chairman, as well\",\n",

What Took So Long? Jho Low’s Wild Nights on Display: $250,000 for DiCaprio, Fox U.S. Offers Support After Banks Face Cyber Hit: Ukraine Update For years, my colleagues at Bloomberg News and I have chronicled serious allegations of racial discrimination against Black workers at Tesla’s auto plant in Fremont, California. Two cases warranted widespread attention just last year. In August, we learned that Tesla had paid Melvin Berry, a former materials handler, $1 million in a rare discrimination award by an arbitrator. In October, a federal jury in San Francisco awarded former contract worker Owen Diaz a staggering $137 million. Tesla appealed the latter ruling, and a federal judge has signaled he’s likely going to cut the size of the award. California’s civil rights regulator, the Department of Fair Employment and Housing, fields complaints from workers throughout the state, including hundreds about Tesla, we learned last week. The way news of the regulator’s lawsuit unfolded was a prime example of Tesla’s aggressive and dismissive attitude toward government agencies, as well as the company’s penchant for preemptively trying to control news cycles and narratives. Here’s a quick recap of how it all went down: On Feb. 7, Tesla filed its annual report to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. There was a two-sentence disclosure on page 91 that DFEH had issued a “notice of cause finding” on Jan. 3 and notified the company that it had grounds to file a civil complaint. This was a clear signal Tesla was probably going to be sued. Early on Feb. 9, Tesla published a blog post titled “The DFEH’s Misguided Lawsuit.” Never mind that the lawsuit hadn’t actually been filed; Tesla was front-running the agency. The company claimed the suit appeared to focus on misconduct that took place from 2015 to 2019; that in almost 50 instances, cases had been closed without finding of misconduct; and that DFEH had “never once raised any concern about\",\n",
       "  'As detailed in a broad SEC filing this week, Tesla gave investors an update on its Bitcoin holdings. Parsing through the disclosure, it boils down to this: Tesla bought around $1.5 billion in bitcoin (BTC-USD) in the early part of 2021; realized a gain of $128 million on a sale of some of its stake earlier in 2021; has now taken a $101 million impairment on the holding as bitcoin’s value has diminished; and currently Tesla’s bitcoin stake has a market value of nearly $2 billion, and a ‘carrying value’ of $1.26 billion Recall that back in the early days of 2021 when Tesla revealed its investment in Bitcoin, it also started accepting Bitcoin as payment for new Tesla cars. CEO Elon Musk then backtracked on that initiative only a few days later, claiming that Tesla was \"concerned\" about the energy needs of mining and transacting Bitcoin with fossil fuels. Musk, a noted crypto enthusiast, has espoused his love for other cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin, and Tesla now accepts Dogecoin for certain merchandise on its website. Tesla also added the title of “Master of Coin” to CFO Zach Kirkhorn in a regulatory filing last year, possibly in reference to the company’s bitcoin holdings. While Tesla’s support of crypto in general may be something the company thinks will be the future of currency and transacting, the question for some is does this fascination with cryptocurrency take its eye off the ball so to speak when so much is transforming in the EV space. “Tesla is doubling down on its Bitcoin strategy despite volatility and investor concerns,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives tells Yahoo Finance. “It remains a distraction and sideshow from the core Tesla story in our opinion during this risk-off backdrop.” For Ives, this sentiment is nothing new. Back in May of 2021 Ives echoed a similar tone in a research note on Tesla’s focus on Bitcoin and backtracking on accepting it for payment: For Tesla and the stock, not accepting Bitcoin does not change the thesis or growth trajectory for the EV story, however it does add to the noise and',\n",

Experts told Bloomberg there won\\'t be enough water in the area when Tesla scales up its factory. It comes after Elon Musk laughed at water supply concerns in August, saying it was \"everywhere.\" Elon Musk last year laughed at suggestions that Tesla\\'s new factory in Germany would take too much water from local supply, but a continued decline in water levels could now delay the plant\\'s development, Bloomberg reported. Groundwater levels in the Brandenburg area have been dropping for the past three decades because of climate change, and the region has experienced droughts in each of the last four years, Bloomberg reported. That means there wouldn\\'t be enough water for residents when Tesla scales up its factory, experts and local authorities told the newswire. Environmental activists, including local environmental group Grüne Liga, have argued that Tesla\\'s German Gigafactory could threaten the area\\'s surroundings, in particular the drinking water. They are now taking Brandenburg\\'s environment office to court, with a first hearing set for March 4, claiming that the effects of climate change were not considered when authorities gave the green light for a groundwater pump for Tesla\\'s Gigafactory, Bloomberg reported. The legal action could result in further delays to the factory, per Bloomberg. Tesla started building the facility near Berlin in early 2020. It was supposed to open on July 1 but has been set back following challenges by environmental activists, permit delays and a lizard problem. The company eventually plans to churn out 500,000 cars at the site. \"This region has so much water, look around you,\" Musk said in reply to a question about the water supply during his visit to the Gigafactory in August, Reuters reported. \"It\\'s like water everywhere here. Does this seem like a desert to you?\" he laughed, per Reuters.

And they could succeed in the not too distant future. \"We expect Tesla\\'s market share to drop from about 70% in EVs to about 20% in the next three years. They [Ford and General Motors] are gaining the bulk of the market share we expect Tesla to lose,\" said Bank of America auto analyst John Murphy on Yahoo Finance Live. While Tesla recently capped off an impressive year of performance, signs have emerged that its market share is slipping as rivals pick up the pace on EVs. Tesla held 66.3% of EV registrations in the second quarter of this year, lower than the 79.5% it held one year ago, according to the most recent data from Experian. GM-owned Chevrolet saw its share of EV registrations rise to 9.6% from 8.3% a year earlier. Ford, Nissan and Audi also picked up market share in the EV industry, per Experian\\'s data. The pressure could continue this year if fresh commentary from Ford and GM are any indication. \"We have about 200,000 reservations [for the F-150 Lightning]. Now we\\'re converting those into orders where people have to physically order the vehicle, almost very few of them are falling out,\" Ford CEO Jim Farley told Yahoo Finance Live last week. Farley added he would like to reach electric vehicle capacity of 600,000 units over the next 22 months. \"We think that\\'ll put us probably number two in electric,\" Farley said.

       "  'President Biden said something completely obvious on Feb. 8 — and it was big news for one of America’s most innovative companies. During an otherwise unremarkable address on domestic manufacturing, Biden referred to Tesla (TSLA) as “our nation’s largest electric vehicle maker.” This is unmistakably true, and nobody disputes it. But up till now, Biden has pushed aggressively for more electric vehicle manufacturing without ever acknowledging that Tesla already produces close to 1 million EVs per year. Instead, Biden has pretended General Motors and Ford are leading the way on electrification. GM (GM) and Ford (F) are not leading. They’re following Tesla, which produced its first EV in 2008 and is now the world’s most valuable car company. Yet, Tesla has been absent from Biden remarks, and while the CEOs of GM and Ford are regulars at White House events, Tesla CEO Elon Musk hasn’t appeared with Biden once. What’s their beef? The short answer: unions. Biden has unabashedly tried to shore up support among union members who have traditionally voted for Democrats but have been drifting to the Republican Party. Former president Barack Obama won 61% of union households in the 2012 election, but Hillary Clinton won just 51% four years later, amid Donald Trump’s aggressive populism and protectionist trade policy. Biden bumped that back up to 57% of union households in the 2020 presidential election, with Trump getting 40%. Union voters helped Biden win the crucial swing states of Michigan and Wisconsin in 2020. But Trump won a majority of union households in Pennsylvania, which Biden won overall, and in Ohio, which Biden lost. So it would be a mistake for Biden and his fellow Democrats to take the union vote for granted. Biden pledged to be “the most pro-union president you’ve ever seen,” and that has materialized in his policies. The most pro-union policy relating to EVs is the tax credit for purchases in Biden’s “Build Back Better” legislation. The original bill included a $7,500 tax credit for anybody buying an electric vehicle, which would effectively cut the price by that amount. Starting in 2026, the credit'],\n",

To be sure, digital tokens are a long way from the crypto market\\'s rip-roaring heyday back in the fall, when Bitcoin (BTC-USD) scaled to a fresh record near $69,000, but Valkyrie\\'s announcement showed how some crypto asset managers are positioning themselves to outlast the whipsaw action. \"From individuals ... to family offices, pensions, and endowments eagerly allocating to hedge funds and trusts, our industry has a firm footing on which to continue growing through the remainder of this year and beyond,\" Valkyrie CEO Leah Wald said in a press release. The firm launched its Strategy Bitcoin fund (BTF), the second SEC approved Bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF), in late October, the firm now manages two other \"bitcoin-adjacent\" ETFs. With approximately $46 million in AUM, the ETF side of Valkyrie\\'s business amounts to a marginal 5% of its bottom line, according Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas. The other 90% of Valkyrie\\'s total assets come from custom built separately managed accounts (SMAs), six different crypto-protocol trusts for accredited investors, as well as overseeing a Decentralized Finance-focused hedge fund captained by Tom Brady\\'s former business manager. Currently said to be in the process of completing its Series B raise, Valkyrie Investments has made an early name in the category of bitcoin ETFs. Cryptocurrencies are still down more than 32% from $2.92 to $1.98 trillion, according to Coinmarketcap.com data, having tumbled in recent weeks in fear over the direction of monetary policy.

       "  'By Medha Singh and Lisa Pauline Mattackal (Reuters) - Bitcoin miners are feeling the heat - and the pain\\'s rippling downstream to pressure prices. The cryptocurrency\\'s spectacular rally in 2021 drew thousands of entrants into mining, or producing new coin. As a result the hashrate, or combined computational power used by bitcoin miners globally, has roughly quadrupled over the past six months to blow past 200 million \"terahashes\" per second. But what\\'s that got to do with the price of bitcoin? A rising hashrate makes it becomes harder for miners to earn coin and cover their costs of hardware, electricity and staff - so many are more likely to sell, rather than hold, their newly minted cryptocurrency, exerting a bearish force on the market. \"Running costs are a major factor in miners\\' decision to hold or sell newly acquired coins. They are the first and most natural sellers in the crypto space and so definitely impact prices,\" said Justin d\\'Anethan, institutional sales director at crypto financial services firm Amber Group. The total value of coins held in miners\\' wallets has fallen to around $75 billion from $114 billion at the start of November, as their profitability has been squeezed by the rising hashrate as well as falling prices, according to Oslo-based crypto research firm Arcane Research. Miners have been transferring more coins to exchanges than adding to reserves, according to crypto industry analytics firms, a sign of selling or intent to sell. Such flows are adding to pressures facing bitcoin, whose drift towards the mainstream has seen it caught up in a selloff in global markets driven by tensions on the Ukraine border and the Federal Reserve\\'s policy tightening. The world\\'s dominant cryptocurrency is trading at about $37,854, which is 45% below its Nov. 10 high of nearly $69,000. WHAT IT COSTS Bitcoin mining, in simple terms, is the process by which a network of computers checks and validates a block of transactions that then get added to the blockchain. Miners get rewarded for completing a block. It\\'s an expensive business, though, requiring not just sophisticated and fast \"rigs\" costing',\n",
       "  'Bitcoin (BTC-USD) suffered yet another brutal bout of risk-aversion on Monday, briefly tumbling by over 5% below $34,000 before staging a recovery as Wall Street rebounded. Amid the turmoil, some $130 billion was yanked out of cryptocurrencies between Sunday and Monday, according to Alex Tapscott, Managing Director of Ninepoint Partner\\'s Digital Asset Group. In the last week alone, Bitcoin shed more than 20% at its troughs, with so-called smart contract currencies faring even worse: Ethereum (ETH-USD) swooned by over 30% within the same period, while Solana (SOL1-USD) has plunged by more than 40%. Outages on the Solana blockchain exacerbated network fees and forced some decentralized finance (DeFi) investors to liquidate their positions. \"Volatility has been the norm historically in digital assets. As an emerging asset class, [crypto\\'s] in a constant state of price discovery,\" Tapscott said on Monday. \"Through their history, digital assets have become accustomed to and therefore resilient to volatility. Even though Bitcoin has been declared dead in the mainstream media more than 400 times, it keeps coming back,\" he added. And true to form, BTC rallied sharply late into the session on Monday as bargain-hunting buyers of risk assets gave prices a boost. Recently, crypto and stocks have moved in near lock-step. However, the depth and severity of the downturn couldn\\'t be more stark for crypto, which has shed a collective $1.43 trillion since the peak in early November, as the Federal Reserve moves to reverse crisis-era liquidity that\\'s fed inflation and inflated asset prices. Monday\\'s volatile price action saw two new Bitcoin-linked exchange-traded funds (ETFs) — launched last fall amid much fanfare — dragged to new record lows (BTF) (BITO) before the rebound. And Bitcoin itself has shed about half of its value since hitting a record last fall near $68,000. Notably, SOL has dropped more than 40%, contributing to its correction, its underlying blockchain, Solana, suffered its latest outage on Friday.

And this comes, of course, after a record run that we saw in these prices last year. But as the CIO, does this latest slide concern you? MATT HOUGAN: It always is uncomfortable when the market goes down, but I think we're actually setting up for an extraordinarily strong second half of the year. Look, the current pullback is being driven by three things, which are going to resolve. One, of course, is the broad market shift to a risk-off market that's pushing through all sorts of risk assets, of which crypto is one. I think we're most of the way there to adjusting to this new reality. The second piece is Biden's executive order on crypto, which is coming out this week. I think once we get past that, that'll be a relief and then some tax-related selling. So I think there's short-term hurdles in front of us. But as I look at the underlying trends, I'm extremely [? bullish ?] about where we end up by the end of this year. EMILY MCCORMICK: And where do you think Bitcoin ends at the end of this year if you have a certain price target in mind? MATT HOUGAN: I'd love to put out a price target.

The 29-year-old said the Fed is likely to remain the key driver of digital asset markets in coming months. Billionaire crypto entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried has said a crypto \"autumn\" — rather than a \"winter\" — may be here, adding that the Federal Reserve will remain the key driver of digital asset markets in the coming months. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have tumbled since hitting record highs in November, as investors brace for the Fed to raise interest rates as it grapples with red-hot inflation. The sharp falls and lower trading volumes on exchanges have stirred chatter of a \"crypto winter\" — a period when prices fall and stay low for a year or more. But Bankman-Fried, who co-founded the FTX crypto exchange in 2019, told Insider on Tuesday: \"I don\\'t think it\\'s really a winter. We\\'re still seeing a lot of activity in this space, and a lot of excitement.\" Instead, he said an \"autumn\" may be a better way to think about it. \"Certainly there has been a slowdown,\" he said.

       "  \"Bitcoin's (BTC-USD) arrival into the mainstream has seen companies like Microstrategy (MSTR), Block (SQ) and Tesla (TSLA) add the digital coin to their balance sheets — and spawned a new class of investors drawing all or part of their salaries in cryptocurrency. But with Bitcoin slumping by nearly half since hitting a November high under $69,000 in the midst of crypto's grim winter, the strategy is not without risk — especially for companies bound by strict corporate accounting rules that some argue are in need of updating. It can also put pressure on the results of firms with crypto on their balance sheets, like Microstrategy — a business intelligence firm turned publicly-traded Bitcoin whale, and make accounting more difficult. Although crypto is back on the rise, for now at least, some observers argue the whipsawing and accounting rules can make valuing cryptocurrencies more onerous for companies and investors, and may dissuade other firms from getting direct exposure to crypto. “You can only mark [Bitcoin] down, you can never mark it up, and in truth I’d be better off, from an accounting point of view, to buy a stack of comic books or baseball cards,” Microstrategy CEO Michael Saylor told Yahoo Finance last week. Based on Generally Accepted Accounting Rules (GAAP) and Securities and Exchanges Commission guidance, digital assets must be recorded as indefinite intangible assets. That means they must be marked down for impairment losses but cannot be marked up for value gains, until the asset is sold. Given crypto volatility, there can be wide swings between the carrying value of Bitcoin and its market value for the same period. For Microstrategy, that equated to a whopping $1.6 billion difference in June, according to the company, which has only gotten worse. As of this week, Microstrategy owns a total of 125,000 Bitcoins, In the company’s fourth quarter earnings, $110.5 million in gross profit got wiped out by a $147 million impairment loss from holding BTC.

Prices have surged to the highest since the start of June on escalating tensions between Russia and the West over Ukraine, and a spike in U.S. inflation to the strongest in decades. At the same time, real interest rates -- a key driver of gold -- have jumped this year, countering the typically inverse correlation between the two. And in the battle over whether Bitcoin is a better modern-day store of value than bullion, the cryptocurrency is losing out, at least for now. “Geopolitical risks have materialized and are escalating,” said Nicky Shiels, head of metals strategy at MKS PAMP SA, a trader and refiner of precious metals. “Gold at $2,000 is a higher probability in the near term, versus $1,800.” The metal traded around the middle of that range on Wednesday. U.S. President Joe Biden unveiled sanctions this week targeting Russia’s sale of sovereign debt abroad and the country’s elites, after Vladimir Putin recognized two self-proclaimed separatist republics in eastern Ukraine as independent, a dramatic escalation in the standoff. Biden described the move as the start of Russia’s invasion of its neighbor, but Moscow has denied any plans to invade. Before demand for a haven took off over Ukraine, bullion’s resilience had been a mystery to some observers, especially in the light of the Federal Reserve’s imminent tightening cycle. One concern was that the U.S. central bank could run the risk of triggering a recession by increasing rates more frequently and to a higher level than potentially needed to tame inflation. “What’s really driving gold is a sense that',\n",

       "  'The hottest U.S. inflation in 40 years lit a fire under Bitcoin (BTC-USD) on Thursday, extending a rally that reversed some of the damage wrought by the \"cryptocurrency winter\" sell-off. The sector has been shaken by the threat of higher interest rates, which the Federal Reserve is poised to do as early as next month. Yet Bitcoin went on a tear, decoupling from stocks in volatile trading on news that January’s inflation rate soared by an annualized 7.5%, the highest since 1982. Bitcoin was whipsawed after the data, but added over 2% on the day to trade comfortably above $45,000, even as other coins like Ethereum (ETH-USD), Cardano (ADA-USD) and Solana (SOL-USD) lagged. Fundstrat noted that while January\\'s sellers appear exhausted, they “have yet to see sustained demand” for “blue chip” cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether. Yet according to Michael Safai, managing partner at Dexterity Capital, a proprietary crypto-trading firm, Bitcoin has now garnered support above $43,000 from bulls, which has risen during the crypto market\\'s resurgence. Until very recently, there\\'s been a tight correlation between technology stocks and cryptocurrencies. Safai told Yahoo Finance that link is a key driver behind crypto\\'s resurgence, following a multi-month rout during which Bitcoin halved its value after hitting a record near $69,000 — sinking to a low of $33,500 on January 24.

Most importantly, Safai explained that unlike prior bouts of volatile trading, \"we’re not seeing a ton of liquidations in the derivatives side of the crypto market.\" A critical leading indicator for shifting investor sentiment, the derivatives side of the crypto market shows both longs and shorts are taking a beating. Of the more than $291 million in liquidated positions over the last 24 hours, a little more than half (59%) were long positions.

       "[\"Tesla’s (TSLA) accusations this week that the Securities and Exchange Commission reneged on a 2018 settlement agreement requiring it to distribute $40 million to shareholders could be backed up by the agency's own rules requiring it to submit a fund distribution plan within 60 days of receiving payment. In a letter filed in federal court in Manhattan on Thursday, attorneys for Tesla claimed the agency held up $40 million in penalty funds that CEO Elon Musk and Tesla paid in 2018 to settle a dispute over his tweet claiming he secured funding that could take the electric vehicle giant private. Tesla’s lawyers have asked the court to examine why shareholders haven't received the money in the more than 1,200 days since Tesla and Musk each handed over $20 million to the agency. “Simply stated, the SEC has failed to comply with its promise to pay Tesla’s shareholders the $40 million it collected,” the letter states. The letter goes on to say that instead of distributing the funds to Tesla shareholders, the SEC has been “devoting its formidable resources to endless, unfounded investigations into Mr. Musk and Tesla.” Should the court agree to address Tesla’s concerns, the SEC will contend with its own rules that set a deadline for plan submissions, as well as its records showing that the vast majority of “available funds” it collects and redirects under the Fair Funds for Investors provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act go to impacted shareholders within two years of a distribution plan's approval. Settlements allocated under the Fair Funds provision can come from either administrative proceedings initiated by the SEC, or from litigation between the SEC and defendants such as Tesla and Musk in federal courts. Tesla’s lawyers say that although nearly three and a half years have passed since Musk and Tesla paid their penalties, the agency has “yet to announce anything like a distribution plan.” The time frame, they argue, flies in the face of the agency’s Rules of Practice, specifying that its enforcement division must submit a proposed distribution plan within 60 days of receiving a defendant’s settlement payment. “As\",\n",

It\\'s the latest shot fired by Musk in his ongoing dispute with the SEC that started in 2018 when he said that he had secured funding for a private buyout of Tesla at $420 a share — something many (including the SEC) interpreted as an attempt at a weed joke. The SEC fined Tesla and Musk $20 million each over that and forced Musk to step down as chairman for at least three years. Tesla also had to implement a system for monitoring Musk\\'s statements about the company on Twitter and other media. Musk has been chafing against those rules lately, however. Earlier this month he accused the SEC of conducting a \"harassment campaign,\" and \"stifling\" has First Amendment free speech rights. The SEC responded earlier this week, saying its frequent check-ins with Tesla were effectively required by the court overseeing the 2018 settlement. It also rebutted Musk\\'s other complaint, saying that it was making progress disbursing the $40 million fine to shareholders as it had promised. Musk\\'s lawyers alleged that at least one SEC member had leaked \"certain information regarding its investigation,\" but it didn\\'t say who or which information. Tesla revealed in its 2021 Q4 earnings report that the SEC subpoenaed the company and Musk, seeking information on how they\\'re complying with the 2018 settlement. Musk previously ran afoul of the 2018 settlement a year later after tweeting information about Tesla vehicle production that wasn\\'t approved by the company\\'s \"disclosure counsel.\" His lawyers accused the SEC of violating his free speech rights then, too.

In particular, the EPA determined that Tesla violated the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Surface Coating of Automobiles and Light-Duty Trucks from October 2016 to September 2019. Tesla, the EPA said, failed to develop and implement a work practice plan to minimize air pollutants emissions from the storage and mixing of materials used in vehicle coating. It also failed to correctly perform the monthly calculations needed to prove that its coating operations complied with the federal standards for hazardous air pollutants. Finally, Tesla apparently failed to keep required records of the calculations for its air pollutants emissions rate. \"People living in communities that are near sources of hazardous air pollutants may face significant risks to their health and environment,\" the agency wrote in its announcement. According to CNBC, the paint shop at Tesla\\'s factory in Fremont suffered several fires within that period. The news organizations talked to employees back in 2018 who claimed that the company pushed to hit production goals at the expense of fire and environmental considerations. (If you\\'ll recall, Tesla was struggling to hit Model 3 production goals at the time.) Those employees claimed that months before a fire in April that year, the shop\\'s sprinkler heads were clogged and were coated with at least an inch of thick paint.

Explained Musk, \"We\\'re not currently working on that $25,000 car. We at some point will. We have enough on our plate right now, too much on our plates, frankly. So at some point there will be, but I think that\\'s sort of a question that it\\'s just sort of the wrong question. Really the thing that overwhelmingly matters is when is the car autonomous.\" Robots appear to be more of a focus inside Tesla than a $25,000 car. Traders let Musk know of their letdown coming off the earnings call. Shares plunged 7.6% to $864 on the session as Tesla said its business would be weighed down by supply chain challenges, mostly as it relates to semiconductor shortages. The company also said it would not unveil any new models this year, let alone a $25,000 EV. \"Overall, while we continue to have an above consensus volume and margin outlook in 2022/\\'23, and assign a premium tech-skewed valuation multiple (~35x EBITDA), that is still not enough for us to recommend the stock at this time,\" added Faghri.

Musk's tweet early Tuesday and a Monday letter from Musk lawyer Alex Spiro to a federal judge didn't offer any specifics about the leak, but the actions ramped up a war of words with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The agency isn't the only federal regulator that Musk is sparring with. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recently has stepped up enforcement against Tesla. Last week, Musk called the agency the “fun police” for making Tesla recall a “Boombox” function that can play sounds over an external speaker and obscure audible warnings for pedestrians. The safety agency has launched multiple investigations of Tesla and is overseeing 15 Tesla recalls since January of 2021. Recalls include “Full Self-Driving” software being programmed to run stop signs at slow speeds. Investigations include unexpected braking by Tesla vehicles. On Monday, Spiro filed another letter with the U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan accusing at least one SEC staff member of leaking information about an investigation of Musk and Tesla's compliance with a court order aimed at controlling his tweets. “It has become clearer and clearer that the commission is out to retaliate against my clients for exercising their First Amendment rights,” Spiro wrote. Tuesday morning, Musk tweeted that the allegations are “just peeling back the first layer of the corruption onion. Stay tuned.” No details were given. The SEC declined comment Tuesday, and messages were left seeking details about the leak allegations from Tesla and Spiro. The SEC spat goes back to 2018, when Musk and Tesla each agreed to pay $20 million in civil fines  over Musk’s tweets about having the money to take the company private at $420 per share.

Jho Low’s Wild Nights on Display: $250,000 for DiCaprio, Fox U.S. Offers Support After Banks Face Cyber Hit: Ukraine Update For years, my colleagues at Bloomberg News and I have chronicled serious allegations of racial discrimination against Black workers at Tesla’s auto plant in Fremont, California. Two cases warranted widespread attention just last year. In August, we learned that Tesla had paid Melvin Berry, a former materials handler, $1 million in a rare discrimination award by an arbitrator. In October, a federal jury in San Francisco awarded former contract worker Owen Diaz a staggering $137 million. Tesla appealed the latter ruling, and a federal judge has signaled he’s likely going to cut the size of the award. California’s civil rights regulator, the Department of Fair Employment and Housing, fields complaints from workers throughout the state, including hundreds about Tesla, we learned last week. The way news of the regulator’s lawsuit unfolded was a prime example of Tesla’s aggressive and dismissive attitude toward government agencies, as well as the company’s penchant for preemptively trying to control news cycles and narratives. Here’s a quick recap of how it all went down: On Feb. 7, Tesla filed its annual report to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. There was a two-sentence disclosure on page 91 that DFEH had issued a “notice of cause finding” on Jan. 3 and notified the company that it had grounds to file a civil complaint. This was a clear signal Tesla was probably going to be sued. Early on Feb. 9, Tesla published a blog post titled “The DFEH’s Misguided Lawsuit.” Never mind that the lawsuit hadn’t actually been filed; Tesla was front-running the agency. The company claimed the suit appeared to focus on misconduct that took place from 2015 to 2019; that in almost 50 instances, cases had been closed without finding of misconduct; and that DFEH had “never once raised any concern about\",\n",
       " 'As detailed in a broad SEC filing this week, Tesla gave investors an update on its Bitcoin holdings. Parsing through the disclosure, it boils down to this: Tesla bought around $1.5 billion in bitcoin (BTC-USD) in the early part of 2021; realized a gain of $128 million on a sale of some of its stake earlier in 2021; has now taken a $101 million impairment on the holding as bitcoin’s value has diminished; and currently Tesla’s bitcoin stake has a market value of nearly $2 billion, and a ‘carrying value’ of $1.26 billion Recall that back in the early days of 2021 when Tesla revealed its investment in Bitcoin, it also started accepting Bitcoin as payment for new Tesla cars. CEO Elon Musk then backtracked on that initiative only a few days later, claiming that Tesla was \"concerned\" about the energy needs of mining and transacting Bitcoin with fossil fuels. Musk, a noted crypto enthusiast, has espoused his love for other cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin, and Tesla now accepts Dogecoin for certain merchandise on its website. Tesla also added the title of “Master of Coin” to CFO Zach Kirkhorn in a regulatory filing last year, possibly in reference to the company’s bitcoin holdings. While Tesla’s support of crypto in general may be something the company thinks will be the future of currency and transacting, the question for some is does this fascination with cryptocurrency take its eye off the ball so to speak when so much is transforming in the EV space. “Tesla is doubling down on its Bitcoin strategy despite volatility and investor concerns,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives tells Yahoo Finance. “It remains a distraction and sideshow from the core Tesla story in our opinion during this risk-off backdrop.” For Ives, this sentiment is nothing new. Back in May of 2021 Ives echoed a similar tone in a research note on Tesla’s focus on Bitcoin and backtracking on accepting it for payment: For Tesla and the stock, not accepting Bitcoin does not change the thesis or growth trajectory for the EV story, however it does add to the noise and',\n",
       " 'Location of Tesla\\'s German Gigafactory has experienced droughts due to climate change, Bloomberg reported. Experts told Bloomberg there won\\'t be enough water in the area when Tesla scales up its factory. It comes after Elon Musk laughed at water supply concerns in August, saying it was \"everywhere.\" Elon Musk last year laughed at suggestions that Tesla\\'s new factory in Germany would take too much water from local supply, but a continued decline in water levels could now delay the plant\\'s development, Bloomberg reported. Groundwater levels in the Brandenburg area have been dropping for the past three decades because of climate change, and the region has experienced droughts in each of the last four years, Bloomberg reported. That means there wouldn\\'t be enough water for residents when Tesla scales up its factory, experts and local authorities told the newswire. Environmental activists, including local environmental group Grüne Liga, have argued that Tesla\\'s German Gigafactory could threaten the area\\'s surroundings, in particular the drinking water. They are now taking Brandenburg\\'s environment office to court, with a first hearing set for March 4, claiming that the effects of climate change were not considered when authorities gave the green light for a groundwater pump for Tesla\\'s Gigafactory, Bloomberg reported. The legal action could result in further delays to the factory, per Bloomberg. Tesla started building the facility near Berlin in early 2020. It was supposed to open on July 1 but has been set back following challenges by environmental activists, permit delays and a lizard problem. The company eventually plans to churn out 500,000 cars at the site. \"This region has so much water, look around you,\" Musk said in reply to a question about the water supply during his visit to the Gigafactory in August, Reuters reported. \"It\\'s like water everywhere here. Does this seem like a desert to you?\" he laughed, per Reuters. Joerg Steinbach, Brandenburg\\'s economy minister, told Bloomberg that \"the current water supply is sufficient for the first stage of the factory\" but when Tesla expands the factory, the area will need more water. Authorities in Brandenburg are supporting efforts to',\n",
       " 'The big guns in the auto industry are coming for Tesla\\'s number one spot in electric vehicles, warns one long-time auto analyst. And they could succeed in the not too distant future. \"We expect Tesla\\'s market share to drop from about 70% in EVs to about 20% in the next three years. They [Ford and General Motors] are gaining the bulk of the market share we expect Tesla to lose,\" said Bank of America auto analyst John Murphy on Yahoo Finance Live. While Tesla recently capped off an impressive year of performance, signs have emerged that its market share is slipping as rivals pick up the pace on EVs. Tesla held 66.3% of EV registrations in the second quarter of this year, lower than the 79.5% it held one year ago, according to the most recent data from Experian. GM-owned Chevrolet saw its share of EV registrations rise to 9.6% from 8.3% a year earlier. Ford, Nissan and Audi also picked up market share in the EV industry, per Experian\\'s data. The pressure could continue this year if fresh commentary from Ford and GM are any indication. \"We have about 200,000 reservations [for the F-150 Lightning]. Now we\\'re converting those into orders where people have to physically order the vehicle, almost very few of them are falling out,\" Ford CEO Jim Farley told Yahoo Finance Live last week. Farley added he would like to reach electric vehicle capacity of 600,000 units over the next 22 months. \"We think that\\'ll put us probably number two in electric,\" Farley said. Meanwhile, General Motors this week struck an upbeat note on demand for its first electric pickup truck. \"More than 110,000 Silverado EVs are reserved so far, including reservations from more than 240 fleet operators, and the numbers keep growing every day,\" GM CEO Mary Barra said on an earnings call.

       " 'President Biden said something completely obvious on Feb. 8 — and it was big news for one of America’s most innovative companies. During an otherwise unremarkable address on domestic manufacturing, Biden referred to Tesla (TSLA) as “our nation’s largest electric vehicle maker.” This is unmistakably true, and nobody disputes it. But up till now, Biden has pushed aggressively for more electric vehicle manufacturing without ever acknowledging that Tesla already produces close to 1 million EVs per year. Instead, Biden has pretended General Motors and Ford are leading the way on electrification. GM (GM) and Ford (F) are not leading. They’re following Tesla, which produced its first EV in 2008 and is now the world’s most valuable car company. Yet, Tesla has been absent from Biden remarks, and while the CEOs of GM and Ford are regulars at White House events, Tesla CEO Elon Musk hasn’t appeared with Biden once. What’s their beef? The short answer: unions. Biden has unabashedly tried to shore up support among union members who have traditionally voted for Democrats but have been drifting to the Republican Party. Former president Barack Obama won 61% of union households in the 2012 election, but Hillary Clinton won just 51% four years later, amid Donald Trump’s aggressive populism and protectionist trade policy. Biden bumped that back up to 57% of union households in the 2020 presidential election, with Trump getting 40%. Union voters helped Biden win the crucial swing states of Michigan and Wisconsin in 2020. But Trump won a majority of union households in Pennsylvania, which Biden won overall, and in Ohio, which Biden lost. So it would be a mistake for Biden and his fellow Democrats to take the union vote for granted. Biden pledged to be “the most pro-union president you’ve ever seen,” and that has materialized in his policies. The most pro-union policy relating to EVs is the tax credit for purchases in Biden’s “Build Back Better” legislation. The original bill included a $7,500 tax credit for anybody buying an electric vehicle, which would effectively cut the price by that amount. Starting in 2026, the credit']"

       "\"Tesla’s (TSLA) accusations this week that the Securities and Exchange Commission reneged on a 2018 settlement agreement requiring it to distribute $40 million to shareholders could be backed up by the agency's own rules requiring it to submit a fund distribution plan within 60 days of receiving payment. In a letter filed in federal court in Manhattan on Thursday, attorneys for Tesla claimed the agency held up $40 million in penalty funds that CEO Elon Musk and Tesla paid in 2018 to settle a dispute over his tweet claiming he secured funding that could take the electric vehicle giant private. Tesla’s lawyers have asked the court to examine why shareholders haven't received the money in the more than 1,200 days since Tesla and Musk each handed over $20 million to the agency. “Simply stated, the SEC has failed to comply with its promise to pay Tesla’s shareholders the $40 million it collected,” the letter states. The letter goes on to say that instead of distributing the funds to Tesla shareholders, the SEC has been “devoting its formidable resources to endless, unfounded investigations into Mr. Musk and Tesla.” Should the court agree to address Tesla’s concerns, the SEC will contend with its own rules that set a deadline for plan submissions, as well as its records showing that the vast majority of “available funds” it collects and redirects under the Fair Funds for Investors provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act go to impacted shareholders within two years of a distribution plan's approval. Settlements allocated under the Fair Funds provision can come from either administrative proceedings initiated by the SEC, or from litigation between the SEC and defendants such as Tesla and Musk in federal courts. Tesla’s lawyers say that although nearly three and a half years have passed since Musk and Tesla paid their penalties, the agency has “yet to announce anything like a distribution plan.” The time frame, they argue, flies in the face of the agency’s Rules of Practice, specifying that its enforcement division must submit a proposed distribution plan within 60 days of receiving a defendant’s settlement payment. “As\""
